###Alphabetize everything
This clean JavaScript based list manipulator is currently a work in progress. As it is open source, feel free to remix/reuse any or all of it as you see fit


Dependencies used are:
Foundation CSS - for base responsive grid,
Normalize CSS - to break all of the styles (mainly browser defaults),
Modernizr JS - for detecting media-queries in javascript,
Jquery JS - for selecting elements, and helping with animations,
